COM_LINKCHECKER_FIELD_MAX_FETCHERS_DESC="Number of the maximal concurrent connections. The default value is three concurrent connections, but some hosters do not allow three concurrent connections or an installed extension may use that much resources on each request that the limitations of your hosting is reached with three concurrent connections.

You can also increase the number of concurrent connections if your server can handle it."
