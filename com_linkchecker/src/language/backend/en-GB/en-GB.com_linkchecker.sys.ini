COM_LINKCHECKER_CONFIGURATION="Link Checker: Configuration"

COM_LINKCHECKER_CONFIG_DESC="The Link Checker service allows you to check up to 500 internal and external URLs for free. If your website has more URLs or you like to use the scheduler for automatic daily checks or like to also check embedded images, then you can buy a token for the <a href="https://www.marcobeierer.com/joomla-extensions/link-checker-professional">Link Checker Professional</a>."
COM_LINKCHECKER_CONFIG_LABEL="General"

COM_LINKCHECKER_FIELD_TOKEN_LABEL="Token"
COM_LINKCHECKER_FIELD_TOKEN_DESC="Your token for the Link Checker."

COM_LINKCHECKER_FIELD_MAX_FETCHERS_LABEL="Concurrent Connections"
COM_LINKCHECKER_FIELD_MAX_FETCHERS_DESC="Number of the maximal concurrent connections. The default value is three concurrent connections, but some hosters do not allow three concurrent connections or an installed extension may use that much resources on each request that the limitations of your hosting is reached with three concurrent connections. With this option you can limit the number of concurrent connections used to access your website and make the Link Checker work under these circumstances. You can also increase the number of concurrent connections if your server can handle it."

COM_LINKCHECKER_FIELD_CUSTOM_WEBSITE_URL_LABEL="Custom Website URL (normally not necessary)"
COM_LINKCHECKER_FIELD_CUSTOM_WEBSITE_URL_DESC="This option can be used to define the URL of your website when your backend runs under another URL than the frontend.<br /><br />If this field is empty, the Link Checker uses the default URL of your website, which should work fine for nearly all users.<br /><br />The website URL has to be provided with the protocol, thus for example <em>https://www.example.com</em>.<br /><br />Using this option disables multilang support of the Link Checker."

COM_LINKCHECKER_CONFIG_LOGIN_DESC="The form login feature allows you to setup a form login that the Link Checker uses to login to your site. This for example allows the Link Checker to check a membership area.<br /><br />Please be very <strong>CAREFUL</strong> with this feature and always backup your site before using it because using this feature can lead to <strong>DATA LOSS</strong> if you make a mistake!<br /><br />It is highly recommended that you create and use a dedicated read-only account for the Link Checker. Read-only because the Link Checker simulates a click on every link on your website and if you for example have an <em>delete button</em>, the Link Checker clicks on it and may delete data if write access is given. A dedicated account is highly recommended because it is technically necessary to store the <strong>PASSWORD IN PLAINTEXT</strong>. You should thus not use this password anywhere else. If you use the scheduler, the provided password is also saved on the Link Checker server.<br /><br />If your login area contains very <strong>sensitive information</strong> that should be protected under all circumstances, you should <strong>not use this feature</strong> at all.<br /><br />Please read the instructions on my website carefully before using this feature:<br /><a href="https://www.marcobeierer.com/tools/link-checker/form-login-instructions">Form Login Instructions</a>."

COM_LINKCHECKER_FIELD_LOGIN_FORM_SELECTOR_LABEL="Form Selector"
COM_LINKCHECKER_FIELD_LOGIN_FORM_SELECTOR_DESC="The DOM query selector to select the login form on the login page, for example <em>#loginform</em> or <em>.loginform</em>.<br /><br />See the instructions on my website for details. There is also an explanation about how to find the selector."

COM_LINKCHECKER_FIELD_LOGIN_DATA_LABEL="Data (Username and Password)"
COM_LINKCHECKER_FIELD_LOGIN_DATA_DESC="Provide all data necessary to login in the POST query format, for example <em>username=xyz&password=qwerty</em>. If you have special characters in your username or password, the values have to be percent encoded.<br /><br />See the instructions on my website for details about how to find this information."
